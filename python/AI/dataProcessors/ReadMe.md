# Info
The ".npy" file generated by ["collectors"](python/AI/collectors) can be copied to this location and when "dataMaker.py" is run number of ".npy" files will be created which will contain images of data charts and directions that market is headed given a chart. These files can be loaded and images can be optimized for neural network. The created files will contain data in following format:

    [
        [
            [255, 199, 0 ,0 ...  
            ... 255, 8, 1, 0], 
            [1, 0, 0]
        ],
        [
            [255, 19, 0 ,0 ...  
            ... 255, 84, 1, 0], 
            [0, 1, 0]
        ],
        [
            [255, 99, 0 ,0 ...  
            ... 25, 43, 1, 0], 
            [0, 0, 1]
        ],
        ....
    ]

    [1,0,0] - price goes down
    [0,1,0] - price stays same
    [0,0,1] - price goes up

Multiple files are created because computer memory might not be enough to hold the whole data to write it to file.
